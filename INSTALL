INSTALLATION

Just put everything at ~/.emacs.d/ and symlink the dotemacs file like this:

 $ ln -s ~/.emacs.d/dotemacs ~/.emacs

Remember to edit user_preferences.el to at least change your email address.

That's all!


DEPENDENCIES

empetado configures the following modes and external elisp files. Those
available using package tools (APT for Debian and Ubuntu in my case) are
supposed to be installed system-wide. Those that aren't are either bundled in
Emacs 22 or included in empetado's configuration.

 * Color theme (color-theme.el, emacs-goodies-el package).
 * Django HTML template mode (django-html-mode.el).
 * Wonderful file and buffer finding (ido.el, emacs-goodies-el package).
 * (Good) Subversion support (psvn.el, subversion package).
 * rope and ropemacs (packages python-rope and python-ropemacs).
 * reStructuredText mode (rst.el, python-docutils package).
 * Better buffer renaming (uniquify.el, bundled with Emacs 22).
 * yasnippet (yasnippet.el, yasnippet package, included because it's not
   present in Ubuntu 8.10).
