INSTALLATION

Just put everything at ~/.emacs.d/ and symlink the dotemacs file like this:

 $ ln -s ~/.emacs.d/dotemacs ~/.emacs

Remember to edit user_preferences.el to at least change your email address.

That's all!


DEPENDENCIES

empetado configures the following modes and external elisp files. Those
available using package tools (APT for Debian in my case) are supposed to be
installed system-wide. Those that aren't are either bundled in Emacs 23 or
included in empetado's configuration.

empetado only supports Emacs 23.

An incomplete list:

 * Color theme (color-theme.el, emacs-goodies-el package).
 * Desktop-mode.
 * Django HTML template mode (django-html-mode.el).
 * EMMS (Emacs MultiMedia System) (emms package).
   * Requires mpg321, ogg123 and mplayer.
   * emms-get-lyrics requires w3m.
 * Wonderful file and buffer finding (ido.elc is bundled with Emacs 23).
 * (Good) Subversion support (psvn.el, subversion package).
 * pymacs, rope and ropemacs (pymacs, python-rope and python-ropemacs packages).
 * reStructuredText mode (rst.el, python-docutils package).
 * Better buffer renaming (uniquify.el, bundled since Emacs 22).
